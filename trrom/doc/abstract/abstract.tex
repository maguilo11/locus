    This users' manual presents how to apply the TRROM algorithm for fast large-scale optimization. The proposed optimization framework relies on the trust region method to progressively improve the predictive reliability of parametric reduced-order models during optimization. The trust region framework enables the application of sound metrics to control the error induced by inexact objective and gradient evaluations during optimization while certifying global convergence. To further improve computational efficiency, the proposed framework relies on the matrix-version of the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM) to efficiently reduced nonaffine parametrized systems arising in partial differential equation (PDE) constrained optimization.
