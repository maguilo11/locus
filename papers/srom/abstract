This work presents a stochastic reduced order modeling approach for the solution of topology optimization problems with input parameters uncertainty. This class of problems is computationally challenging due to the number of model evaluations required to quantify and propagate input parameters uncertainty. This computational challenge is magnified if a high-fidelity simulation is used to solve the topology optimization problem. In this work, a stochastic reduced order model approach is applied to 1) reduce the prohibitive computational cost associated with the solution of a topology optimization problem with input parameters uncertainty; and 2) quantify and propagate inherent uncertainties due to the input parameters. The stochastic reduced order model framework transforms the topology optimization problem with input parameters uncertainty into a deterministic  topology optimization problem that relies only on independent calls to a deterministic analysis engine. This flexibility enables the use of existing optimization and analysis tools to solve the topology optimization problem with input parameters uncertainty. Numerical results will show the advantages associated with the stochastic reduced order model framework presented in this work.
