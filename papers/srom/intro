\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This work is concern with the solution of topology optimization problems constrained by a system of stochastic algebraic equations. The solution to the system of stochastic algebraic equations is considered to be a random element. The stochastic topology optimization problems are solved using the stochastic reduced order model (SROM) approach to approximate the randomness introduced by the input parameters to the finite element model. The randomness will be introduced through uncertainty in the orientation of the applied loads and the elastic modulus of the materials. The material distribution will be computed by solving the following topology optimization problem with parametric uncertainty:
\begin{equation}
\label{topOptProblemIntro}
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{X}^{\ast}=\underset{\mathcal{X}}{\arg \min}: & \;\; \bm{F}(\widehat{\mathcal{X}})\\
%\text{subject to } : & \;\;  \bm K(\bm x)\bm U = \bm F(\mathcal{\theta})\quad\mbox{in}\quad\Omega\quad\mbox{a.s.} \\
%			 :  & \;\; \frac{V(\bm x)}{V_0} \leq \gamma \\
%			 : & \;\; \bm 0 \leq \bm x \leq \bm 1
\text{subject to } : & \;\; \bm{R}(\bm U,\widehat{\mathcal{X}}, \Sigma; \Theta) = \bm 0 \quad\mbox{in}\quad\Omega\quad\mbox{a.s.} \\
			 :  & \;\; \bm{G}(\widehat{\mathcal{X}}) \leq 0 \\
			 : & \;\; \bm 0 \leq \bm x_m \leq \bm 1,
\end{aligned} 
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{X}^{\ast}=\{{\bm x}^{\ast}_m\}_{m=1}^M$ is the optimal set of control points, $\mathcal{X}=\{{\bm x}_m\}_{m=1}^M$ is the set of trial control points, and $\widehat{\mathcal{X}}=\{\hat{\bm x}_m\}_{m=1}^M$ is the set of filtered control points. The total number of design variables $N_{\tiny{\bm x}}=M\times n_{\bm x}$, where $M$ is the number of candidate materials and $n_{\bm x}$ is the number of control points. The number of control points is set to either the number of nodes or the number of elements on the computational mesh. The density at the control points for a given candidate material is denoted by $\bm x_m$. The filtered densities associated with the $k$ set of control points in finite element $e$ and candidate material $m$ is denoted by $\hat{\bm x}^k_m$. $\bm{F}$ is the random objective function and $\bm G$ is the inequality constraint. The random residual equation is denoted by $\bm{R}$ and the computational domain is denoted by $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{d},\ d\in\{1,2,3\}$. Finally, $\Sigma$ and $\Theta$ are the random elastic modulus and load orientations, respectively.\\

The inequality constraint $\bm G$ in \ref{topOptProblemIntro} is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:VolumeConstraint}
\sum_{m=1}^{M}\sum_{e=1}^{N_e} z_m^e(\hat{\bm x}^k_m)\gamma_mV_e - \mathrm{M}_{\max},
\end{equation} 
will be used for the topology optimization examples presented herein. In \ref{eq:VolumeConstraint}, $V_e$ denotes the volume of finite element $e$, $\mathrm{M}_{\max}$ is the mass or monetary limit, $\gamma_m$ is the mass density or cost of material $m$ and $N_e$ is the total number of finite elements. The filtered volume fraction in element $e$ for candidate material $m$ is denoted by $z_m^e$. The volume constraint is defined using the filtered volume fractions $z_m^e$ for candidate material $m$, but the filtered densities at the control points $\hat{\bm{x}}_m$ for candidate material $m$ can be defined as nodal or element control points. Therefore, the filtered material density $z_m^e$ at each element $e$ for candidate material $m$ can be computed from $\hat{\bm x}_m$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:elemMatDensity}
z_m^e(\hat{\bm x}^k_m)=\frac{1}{\hat{n}_m^{e}}\sum_{k\in\mathcal{K}_m^e}\hat{\bm x}^k_m,
\end{equation} 
where $\hat{n}_m^e$ is the number of control points in the set $\mathcal{K}_m^e$ of control points associated with element $e$ and candidate material $m$. If nodal control points are used in \eqref{eq:elemMatDensity}, $\hat{n}_m^e$ is equal to the number of nodes on finite element $e$. Contrary, if element control points are used, $\hat{n}_m^e=1$. \\

The filtered control points $\hat{\bm x}_m$ in \ref{eq:elemMatDensity} are computed by applying a kernel filter to control points ${\bm x}_m$. The kernel filter is applied to avoid numerical artifacts that may result from the discretization of the control points ${\bm x}_m$ with possibly unstable finite element formulations \cite{sigmund1998,Sigmund2007}. Specifically, a linear kernel filter \cite{bourdin2001filters,bruns2001topology}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:filter}
F_{ik}=\max\left(0,1-\frac{d(i,k)}{R}\right)
\end{equation}
is applied to the control points ${\bm x}_m$ to avoid the aforementioned numerical artifacts. Therefore, the filtered control points $\hat{\bm{x}}^k_m$ for candidate material $m$ are given by 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:FilteredControlPt}
\hat{\bm{x}}_m^k=\sum_{i=1}=w^{ik}\bm{x}_m^i, 
\end{equation}
where the weights in \eqref{eq:FilteredControlPt} are defined as 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:weights}
w^{ik}=\frac{F_{ik}}{\sum_{l\in\mathcal{N}_k}F_{lk}}.
\end{equation}
In Equations \eqref{eq:filter}-\eqref{eq:weights}, $d(i,k)$ is the distance between control points $\bm{x}_m^i$ and $\bm{x}_m^k$ for candidate material $m$ and $R$ is the filter's radius of influence. $\mathcal{N}_{k}=\{\bm{x}_m^i\colon d(i,k)\leq{R}\}$ is the neighborhood of control points that are inside the radius $R$, including the control points on the boundary of the radius, with respect to control point $\bm{x}_m^k$. \\

The topology optimization problem with parametric uncertainty defined in \eqref{topOptProblemIntro} is constrained by a system of stochastic algebraic equations
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:stochastic_model}
\bm R(\bm U, \widehat{\mathcal{X}},  \Sigma; \Theta) = [\bm K( \widehat{\mathcal{X}}, \Sigma)] \bm U - \bm L(\Theta),
\end{equation}
where $\bm U$ and $\bm L$ are the random global displacement and load vectors, respectively. The global displacement and load vectors are now random due to their dependence on the random orientation of the applied loads $\Theta$ and elastic modulus of the materials $\Sigma$. The solution of \eqref{topOptProblemIntro} depends on the suitable parameterization of $\Sigma$ and $\Theta$ to make the solution of the stochastic partial differential equation and the evaluation of the random objective function tractable. This paper will focus on the application of SROMs as an efficient means of quantifying and propagating the uncertainty in $\Sigma$ and $\Theta$ on the quantities of interest. \\

The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In the next section, the motivation for this work is discussed. In the subsequent section, 1) the deterministic topology optimization formulations, 2) the generic description of the SROM approach, and 3) the stochastic topology optimization formulations based on an SROM representation of the random input parameters are presented. In this section, the gradient derivation for the stochastic topology optimization problems and the steps required to compute the gradient are also presented. Next, the results associated with the topology optimization problems with parametric uncertainty are presented and discussed. Finally, the article concludes with a summary of this work.
