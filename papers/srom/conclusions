\section{\label{sec:conclusions}Conclusions}

In this study, a novel framework for multi-material structural topology optimization under uncertainty using stochastic reduced order models (SROMs) is proposed. By considering the structural topology optimization problem as a constrained stochastic optimization problem, the approach was formulated in terms of minimizing the expected value of the objective function with a stochastic model constraint. The non-intrusive nature of the SROM approximation transforms the constrained stochastic optimization problem into a deterministic one with decoupled, deterministic physics model constraints. Therefore, the use of SROMs allows for a widely applicable method that relies solely on calls to existing deterministic analysis solvers and optimization libraries. Furthermore, since the model evaluations are completely independent from one another, the approach is embarrassingly parallel and hence scalable to large design problems. \\

The effectiveness of the proposed SROM framework on a multi-material structural topology optimization problem with a random load and candidate material was demonstrated. Through two numerical examples, the importance of accounting for uncertainties due to multiple inherent design imperfections when designing a structure was shown. Furthermore, the approach can accurately and efficiently quantify and propagate the statistics of a random load and material during optimization. The method was shown to require a small number of samples to characterize the statistics of multiple random inputs, drastically reducing the computational cost associated with the multi-material structural topology optimization problem under uncertainty.
