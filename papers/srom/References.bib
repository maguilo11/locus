  abstract={As a novel tool for quantitative 3D internal deformation measurement throughout the interior of a material or tissue, digital volume correlation (DVC) has increasingly gained attention and application in the fields of experimental mechanics, material research and biomedical engineering. However, the practical implementation of DVC involves important challenges such as implementation complexity, calculation accuracy and computational efficiency. In this paper, a least-squares framework is presented for 3D internal displacement and strain field measurement using DVC. The proposed DVC combines a practical linear-intensity-change model with an easy-to-implement iterative least-squares (ILS) algorithm to retrieve 3D internal displacement vector field with sub-voxel accuracy. Because the linear-intensity-change model is capable of accounting for both the possible intensity changes and the relative geometric transform of the target subvolume, the presented DVC thus provides the highest sub-voxel registration accuracy and widest applicability. Furthermore, as the ILS algorithm uses only first-order spatial derivatives of the deformed volumetric image, the developed DVC thus significantly reduces computational complexity. To further extract 3D strain distributions from the 3D discrete displacement vectors obtained by the ILS algorithm, the presented DVC employs a pointwise least-squares algorithm to estimate the strain components for each measurement point. Computer-simulated volume images with controlled displacements are employed to investigate the performance of the proposed DVC method in terms of mean bias error and standard deviation error. Results reveal that the present technique is capable of providing accurate measurements in an easy-to-implement manner, and can be applied to practical 3D internal displacement and strain calculation.}

  abstract={Developments in digital image correlation in the last two decades have made it a popular and effective tool for full-field displacement and strain measurements in experimental mechanics. In digital image correlation, the use of the sub-pixel registration algorithm is regarded as the key technique to improve accuracy. Different types of sub-pixel registration algorithms have been developed. However, little quantitative research has been carried out to compare their performances. This paper investigates three types of the most commonly used sub-pixel displacement registration algorithms in terms of the registration accuracy and the computational efficiency using computer-simulated speckle images. A detailed examination of the performances of each algorithm reveals that the iterative spatial domain cross-correlation algorithm (Newtonâ€“Raphson method) is more accurate, but much slower than other algorithms, and is recommended for use in these applications.}

title="Three-dimensional Full-field Measurements of Large Deformations in Soft Materials Using Confocal Microscopy and Digital Volume Correlation",
journal="Experimental Mechanics",
year="2007",
volume="47",
number="3",
pages="427--438",
abstract="A three-dimensional (3-D) full-field measurement technique was developed for measuring large deformations in optically transparent soft materials. The technique utilizes a digital volume correlation (DVC) algorithm to track motions of subvolumes within 3-D images obtained using fluorescence confocal microscopy. In order to extend the strain measurement capability to the large deformation regime (>5{\%}), a stretch-correlation algorithm was developed and implemented into the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based DVC algorithm. The stretch-correlation algorithm uses a logarithmic coordinate transformation to convert the stretch-correlation problem into a translational correlation problem under the assumption of small rotation and shear. Estimates of the measurement precision are provided by stationary and translation tests. The proposed measurement technique was used to measure large deformations in a transparent agarose gel sample embedded with fluorescent particles under uniaxial compression. The technique was also employed to measure non-uniform deformation fields near a hard spherical inclusion under far-field uniaxial compression. Introduction of the stretch-correlation algorithm greatly improved the strain measurement accuracy by providing better precision especially under large deformation. Also, the deconvolution of confocal images improved the accuracy of the measurement in the direction of the optical axis. These results shows that the proposed technique is well-suited for investigating cell-matrix mechanical interactions as well as for obtaining local constitutive properties of soft biological materials including tissues in 3-D.",
